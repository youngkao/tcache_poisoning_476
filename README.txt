Here is a little tcache poisoning problem I put together with help from https://tripoloski1337.github.io/research/2019/09/09/tcache_poisoning.html
I wasn't able to fully make one on my own, but using Arsalan's help I was able to play around with it and create a solution script,
while also learning a new pwning method.
